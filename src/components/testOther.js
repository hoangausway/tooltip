        Why do I sometimes get an old state or prop value inside my effect?
        Effects always ‚Äúsee‚Äù props and state from the render they were defined
        in. That helps prevent bugs but in some cases can be annoying. For those
        cases, you can explicitly maintain some value in a mutable ref (the
        linked article explains it at the end). If you think you‚Äôre seeing some
        props or state from an old render but don‚Äôt expect it, you probably
        missed some dependencies. Try using the lint rule to train yourself to
        see them. A few days, and it‚Äôll be like a second nature to you. See also
        this answer in our FAQ.

          Question: How do I replicate componentDidMount with useEffect?

            How do I replicate componentDidMount with useEffect?
          </TipQuestion1>
        </StyledQuestion>
      </p>
      <p>
        While you can useEffect(fn, []), it‚Äôs not an exact equivalent. Unlike
        componentDidMount, it will capture props and state. So even inside the
        callbacks, you‚Äôll see the initial props and state. If you want to see
        ‚Äúlatest‚Äù something, you can write it to a ref. But there‚Äôs usually a
        simpler way to structure the code so that you don‚Äôt have to. Keep in
        mind that the mental model for effects is different from
        componentDidMount and other lifecycles, and trying to find their exact
        equivalents may confuse you more than help. To get productive, you need
        to ‚Äúthink in effects‚Äù, and their mental model is closer to implementing
        synchronization than to responding to lifecycle events.

      <p>
        This article is a good primer on data fetching with useEffect. Make sure
        to read it to the end! It‚Äôs not as long as this one. [] means the effect
        doesn‚Äôt use any value that participates in React data flow, and is for
        that reason safe to apply once. It is also a common source of bugs when
        the value actually is used. You‚Äôll need to learn a few strategies
        (primarily useReducer and useCallback) that can remove the need for a
        dependency instead of incorrectly omitting it.

      </p>
      <p>
        The recommendation is to hoist functions that don‚Äôt need props or state
        outside of your component, and pull the ones that are used only by an
        effect inside of that effect. If after that your effect still ends up
        using functions in the render scope (including function from props),
        wrap them into useCallback where they‚Äôre defined, and repeat the
        process. Why does it matter? Functions can ‚Äúsee‚Äù values from props and
        state ‚Äî so they participate in the data flow. There‚Äôs a more detailed
        answer in our FAQ.

            Why do I sometimes get an infinite refetching loop?
          </TipQuestion4>
        </StyledQuestion>
      </p>
      <p>
        This can happen if you‚Äôre doing data fetching in an effect without the
        second dependencies argument. Without it, effects run after every render
        ‚Äî and setting the state will trigger the effects again. An infinite loop
        may also happen if you specify a value that always changes in the
        dependency array. You can tell which one by removing them one by one.
        However, removing a dependency you use (or blindly specifying []) is
        usually the wrong fix. Instead, fix the problem at its source. For
        example, functions can cause this problem, and putting them inside
        effects, hoisting them out, or wrapping them with useCallback helps. To
        avoid recreating objects, useMemo can serve a similar purpose.
